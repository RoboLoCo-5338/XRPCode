# Version 1.0.3

This is the staging version for bluetooth

#### Bluetooth
# Please read the steps below!!

* Connect your XRP with a cable
* Let the IDE upgrade the Micropython and XRPLib
* ** after installing XRPLib you will need to hit reset before using the bluetooth **
* When you click CONNECT it will bring up a list of XRPs that are near the computer
    * If you want a cable instead, click cancel and it will go to the cable dialog
* The Bluetooth XRP name is unique per XRP. The one closest should have the strongest signal
* Once connected the IDE should be the same as if connected via a cable
* If the XRP is reset / turned off / too far away the IDE will show RE-CONNECT XRP for 10 seconds and then switch to CONNECT.
    * If the XRP is turned back on / brought closer the IDE will auto re-connect to the XRP within that 10 seconds
* If you start the XRP and a program runs keeping the bluetooth from connecting then press reset and it should restart without running the program

#### Fixed
* Input is now accepted in XRP applications
* The REPL stays live from run to run and has information from the last running program like globals and classes
    *When STOP is used the REPL is reset.


#### REPORT Problems
* Thank you for testing, please report problems to the slack or fgrossman@firstnh.org
* Working to reliably reproduce the problem before reporting is greatly appreciated
* I have noticed that some older laptops have very slow bluetooth connections
# Version 1.0.3.L
